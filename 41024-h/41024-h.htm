<p>The Gairdner edition of the Paston Letters was printed in six volumes.
Each volume is a separate e-text; Volume VI is further divided into two
e-texts, Letters and Index. Volume&nbsp;I, the General Introduction,
will be released after all other volumes, matching the original
publication order.</p>

<p>All brackets are in the original, as are parenthetical question marks
and (<i>sic</i>) notations. Series of dots representing damaged text are
shown as printed. Note that the printed book used <b>z</b> to represent
original yogh <b>ȝ</b>. This has not been changed for the e-text. The
copy number (first page of each volume) is hand-written.</p>

<p>The year of each letter was printed in a sidenote at the top of the
page; this has been merged with the sidenote at the beginning of each
letter. Footnotes have their original numbering, with added page number
to make them usable with the full Index. They are grouped at the end of
each Letter or Abstract.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title ="like this">Text lightly shaded in
violet</ins> indicates the site of a typographical error. Hover the
cursor over the shaded text, and the explanation should appear.
Typographical errors are listed again at the end of the Letter,
after any footnotes. In the primary text, errors were only
corrected if they are clearly editorial, such as missing italics, or
mechanical, such as <span class = "locked">u-for-n</span> misprints.
Italic “d” misprinted as “a” was a recurring problem. The word
“invisible” means that there is an appropriately sized blank space, but
the letter or punctuation mark itself is missing.</p>

<p><i>Some Specifics:</i> The spelling “Jhon” is not an error. Gresham
and Tresham are different people. Conversely, the inconsistent spelling
of the name “Lipyate” or “Lipgate” in footnotes is unchanged.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 220.] There is abundant evidence that the year in which
this letter was written was 1454. The references to Lord Grey’s offer of
a husband for Elizabeth Paston, and to Sir John Fastolf’s going into
Norfolk, of which William Paston had before written by anticipation,
though a little prematurely, in No.&nbsp;254,
are in themselves sufficient to fix the chronology; but the mention of
fealty having been done by a new Archbishop of Canterbury and a new
Bishop of Ely removes any possible doubt on the subject.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 376.] This letter must have been written during one of
the periods of the Duke of York’s ascendency, and on a comparison of
possible years I am inclined to assign it to 1454. The date 1460, to
which Fenn ascribes it, would have been highly probable but for the fact
that John Paston, who was returned to Parliament in that year, does not
appear to have arrived in London even on the 12th October, so that
probably he had not left Norwich on the 6th.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 80.] There is no doubt about the date of this letter. The
King fell ill at Clarendon in the autumn of 1453, and remained in a
state of utter imbecility during the greater part of the year 1454, so
that in March a deputation from the House of Peers, sent to communicate
with him on the death of his Chancellor, Cardinal Kemp, was obliged to
report that they had been utterly unable to obtain from him any answer
or sign that he understood the least thing said to him. It appears from
this letter that his recovery was about Christmas, when he heard for the
first time of the birth of his son fourteen months before, and of the
death of Cardinal Kemp nine months before.</p>

[This letter could not have been written before the year 1455, as Sir
John Fastolf only came to reside at Castre in the autumn of the year
preceding. The wardship of Thomas Fastolf was procured by Sir John for
John Paston in June 1454, so that it is highly probable he had to pay
for it in the beginning of next year. In the year following, again,
Fastolf was endeavouring to make good those claims against the Crown,
which he here merely mentions as a ground of indulgence to himself.]</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The rectory
of Stokesby in Norfolk was vacant in the year 1455. The right of
presentation ought to have belonged to Sir John Fastolf, as John
Fastolf&mdash;doubtless of Cowhawe&mdash;had presented in 1444; but it
was allowed to lapse to the Bishop, who presented Simon Thornham, LL.D.
Afterwards it appears that James Gloys was rector, who must have been
presented by John or Margaret Paston. This letter was probably written a

the person addressed is not named, the style in which he is addressed,
and particularly the last sentence, leave no doubt that it is the Duke
of Norfolk. Indeed, this is not unlikely to be the letter mentioned in
the postscript to the last, of which a copy or draft was sent along with
the original to John Paston that he might deliver the latter, only if he
approved of its contents. If so, it is probable that Paston withheld it,
as we find by the letter immediately following that Fastolf addressed
another memorial to the Duke on the subject of his dispute with
Wentworth four days later.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 338.] Although there is no direction upon this letter,
it was evidently addressed to the Duke of Norfolk, as it speaks of ‘your
Castle of Framlingham.’ The absence of any written address Fenn accounts
for by supposing the letter to have been enclosed in a cover; but as it
appears that the original contained at least one passage which was
crossed out (<i>see</i> page 341 in Fenn), we may with greater
probability consider it to have been a corrected draft, like the last,
sent to John Paston for his approval. The dispute with Sir Philip
Wentworth and the matters of John Porter and Sir Thomas Howes, here
referred to, both point to the year 1455 as the date of this
letter.&mdash;<i>See</i> <a href = "#letter265">Nos. 265</a>, <a href =

[From Fenn, iii. 146.] John Crane of Woodnorton, whom we suppose to have
been the writer of Letters 121 and 285, had a wife of the name of Alice,
who was apparently a widow in 1457, when she presented to the living of
Woodnorton (<i>see</i> Blomefield, iv. 313). But the writer of this was
more probably a daughter, serving in the household of a lady of rank
according to the custom of the times. If so, the date is before John
Crane’s death, which must have happened between 1455 and 1457.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 128.] At the date of this letter, William Worcester and
his master, Sir John Fastolf, were both at Caister, though the latter
was thinking of going up to London. This, being in July, cannot have
been before 1455. Fenn supposes the pardon to Poynings to have been on
account of his participation in Cade’s rebellion, and accordingly dates
this letter ‘about 1451.’ But Poynings was accused of raising
disturbances in 1453 and 1454. The reversal of Sir William Oldhall’s
outlawry was in 1455; for we have seen in <a href =
"#letter287">No.&nbsp;287</a> that he was obliged to remain in sanctuary
for some little time after the battle of St. Albans. It appears by an
<i>inspeximus</i> on Patent Roll, 34 Hen. <span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>, m. 16, that he presented a petition to the King
in Parliament on the 9th July, 33 Hen. <span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span> (1455), setting forth how he had served the King
in France, and yet had been pronounced a traitor by the Parliament of
Reading in 31 Hen. <span class = "smallroman">VI.</span>, but that his
outlawry had been reversed in the King’s Bench.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 32.] This letter is attributed by Fenn to the year 1461,
but that date is certainly inaccurate, as it was answered by John Paston
at Norwich the very day it was written, whereas in July 1461 Paston was
in London. Moreover, it certainly could not have been <i>after</i> 1461,
as Sir Thomas Tuddenham was beheaded in February of the following year.
It must therefore belong to the reign of Henry <span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>; and considering the time of the year, 1455 is
the only date at which it is at all likely that any one would have
ventured to attempt the impeachment of Tuddenham and Heydon in
Parliament, or could have been plausibly accused of such a design
against persons of so much influence.</p>

November 1454 Sir John Fastolf wrote to Paston about the goods of the
Duke of Bedford, but the subject recurred to his thoughts for more than
a year afterwards, and particularly in January 1456, when all the other
executors of the Duke were dead. This letter is certainly before the
death of Lord Cromwell, and therefore not later than 1455; but it seems

unum vel duos, ut in ore duorum vel trium testium stet omne verbum. Quod
si non audierit, dic ecclesiæ; si autem ecclesiam non audierit, sit tibi
sicut ethnicus et publicanus,’ etc. And in another place, ‘Tunc accedens
Petrus ad Jesum dixit, Domine, quotiens petevit [<i>peccabit</i>] in me

[From Fenn, iii. 278.] The date of this letter is doubtful. The two
pieces of intelligence at the beginning were certainly both false
rumours, as the writer, indeed, seems to have suspected. Henry <span
class = "smallroman">VI.</span> never went to Scotland in manner of war,
and the Earl of Wiltshire never was made Chancellor. But the time when
those rumours seem most likely to have arisen was in the year 1456, when
the Duke of York had been deprived of the Protectorate. The Earl of
Wiltshire, being of the opposite party to York, was not unlikely to have
been talked of as Chancellor, although the Chancellorship was given on
the 7th of March to the Archbishop of Canterbury. As to the rumoured
expedition against Scotland, we know that in the preceding year James
<span class = "smallroman">II.</span>, in defiance of the truce, laid
siege to Berwick, which offered a gallant resistance (Nicolas’s <i>Privy
Council Proceedings</i>, vi. 248). This, however, does not appear
immediately to have led to open war between the two countries.
Diplomatic relations were still carried on till, on the 10th of May
1456, James <span class = "smallroman">II.</span> despatched Lyon Herald
to the King of England to declare plainly that the Truce of 1453 was
injurious to Scotland, and that he did not mean to abide by it (Lambeth
<span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 211, f. 146&nbsp;b). No reply was
made to this message till the 26th of July, when an answer was
despatched by the Duke of York in the King’s name (<i>see</i> Rymer, xi.
383); but there can be little doubt the desire to punish the insolence
of the Scots must have been very general long before.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] Dr. John
Brackley, the writer of this letter, was a Grey Friar of Norwich, of
considerable celebrity as a preacher. Several letters of his are found
in this collection, written in the years 1459 and 1460. This, however,
must be a few years earlier, as in 1459 Brackley writes of William
Worcester in very different terms. The handwriting also is not so close
as that of his later letters. We cannot, however, carry the date further
back than 1455, as it seems that Worcester and Howes were at this time
together, which must have been at Caister. Nor will the year 1455 itself
suit all the circumstances of the letter, for it is evident that John
and William Paston were also together, and as the writer asks John
Paston to speak to Yelverton, it may be presumed they were in London.
Now, John Paston was certainly not in London within a week after St.
John the Baptist’s Day in 1455. We have therefore placed the letter in
1456. It will be observed that, on the 1st of June in that year, John
Russe advised Paston to go up to London.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 166.] This letter must have been written about the time
Sir John Fastolf first began to make inquiry on what terms he could
obtain a licence for establishing a college at Caister,&mdash;a project
which he had much at heart during the latter years of his life.
A&nbsp;letter from Sir John himself upon this subject will be found a
little further on, dated the 18th November (<a href =
"#letter351">No.&nbsp;351</a>), and we think it probable that this is of
the same year, 1456.</p>

Edward Nevill, Lord Abergavenny, was twice married. His first wife, to
whom he owed his title, was Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Beauchamp,
Earl of Worcester. His second was Catherine, daughter of Sir Robert
Howard. The Lady here mentioned is probably the former, for though
Dugdale says he obtained a dispensation for his second marriage in 1448,
that date is inconsistent with the age of his son and other facts
mentioned.</p>

is dated by the writer in the 35th year of Henry <span class =

written. The 35th of Henry <span class = "smallroman">VI.</span> was
reckoned from the 1st September 1456 to the 31st August 1457. Taken in
connection with the postscript of Botoner’s letter immediately preceding
(the date of which letter this partly confirms), it is not unlikely that
this was written about October. Perhaps ‘Wednesday after messe’ should
have been ‘Wednesday after Michaelmesse.’ If so, the exact date would be
October 6th.</p>

The wardship of Thomas Fastolf was at first granted to John Paston and
Thomas Howes, by patent of the 6th June 1454, and for this they agreed
to pay 100 marks into the Exchequer. But, for some reason or other,
a&nbsp;new arrangement was made, and the wardship was granted by another
patent, dated 12th December 1454, to John Bokkyng and William Worcestre,
who offered the King 20 marks over what Paston had offered, <i>i.e.</i>
£80 in all.&mdash;See <i>Patent Roll</i>, 33 Hen. <span class =

[The date of this letter appears to be 1456. Of the years when Fastolf
resided at Caister, it is not 1454, because in that year Barker could
not have been in London on the 10th November (<i>see</i> <a href =
"#letter265">No.&nbsp;265</a>). It is not 1455, because Worcester
appears to have been at that time at Caister (<i>see</i> <a href =

appears to have been the case in 1457, though we can only judge by a

him.]</p>

<div class = "abstract">
<p>Received certain letters by Henry Hanson on Thursday last, including
one from William Barker written in Lukett’s hand, and two bills of
supplication, one of which, in the name of the tenants of Cotton, he has
sent to Paston, as he has already written. John Russe and Geoff.
Spyrlyng have ridden to Cotton in consequence, and will inform Paston
how they speed. Thinks the bill ‘right good and well spoken according to
the truth of their riotous demeaning.’ Received at the same time a bill
written in his own name, of which he approves. Hears that young Henry
Wentworth, young Calthorpe, and young Brews were at the distress-taking,
among others. Has perfect confidence in Paston as to the treaty, and
hopes to obtain again the manor of Bradwell by some means, as clear as
he had it before his unhappy release. Hears that the Chief Justice
‘rectid the matter’ in Parliament before the Lords, and showed how
Fastolf was wronged in that it was untruly found by the office that he
had disseised Sir Hue Fastolf of the manor, whereas he has documents
proving a true sale. My Lady of York has been here, ‘and sore moved me
for the purchase of Castre.’ Begs him to devise means for the licence of
mortising of certain buildings for the foundation of a college, ‘as ye
and I have commoned of before.’ William Worcester can show him a copy of
one passed by the King, and signed ready to the late Chancellor
Stafford. Desires him to make himself acquainted with two chaplains
about my Lord of Canterbury and my Lord Chancellor. William Barker
writes of a general treaty, to which he can make no answer further than
he has already done to Yelverton and Paston.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 164.] This letter, as printed by Fenn, bears no date in
itself, but in the editorial note at the foot it is dated: ‘Caister,
18th of November.’ Probably this date is expressed in the original, but
has been accidentally omitted in the printing. If so, the year in which
it was written must be either 1456 or 1457, and most probably the
former. In 1455 the Archbishop of Canterbury and my Lord Chancellor were
one and the same person, which they evidently are not here; and in 1458
it appears by the Castlecombe <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>
that Sir John Fastolf was in London on the 26th November, so that he is
not likely to have been expecting a visit from the Duke of Norfolk at
Caister eight days before. On the other hand, if this was written in the
year 1456, it must be remembered that Archbishop Bourchier had been just
recently discharged of the office of Lord Chancellor, which was given to
Bishop Waynfleet on the 11th October, and it is highly probable that the
Archbishop had been already spoken to on the subject in his capacity of
Chancellor.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The date of
this letter is very uncertain. In 1456 the writer dates from Southwark
on the 8th of May, and in 1458 from London on the 14th of March, so that
there is rather a presumption against his being at Caister on the 2nd of
April in either of these years. But these points, it must be owned, are
little to be relied on, as Bokking certainly passed to and fro a good
deal between London and Norfolk. The date must, however, be between 1455
and 1459. The letter has no address, but was doubtless intended for John
Paston.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 298.] That this letter was written in the year 1457
appears pretty clear from its agreement with the last, in which Botoner
speaks of the expediency of getting the accounts of Fastolf’s household
audited, and mentions that his master was sending him up to London.
A&nbsp;further confirmation of the date may be found in the dates of the
Privy Seals of the 35th year of Henry <span class =

would seem to be Justice Yelverton. Mr. Poulett Scrope, however, in his
privately printed <i>History of Castlecombe</i> (p.&nbsp;277), says it
was Sir Richard Bingham, whose daughter Joan Stephen Scrope had by this
time married. It is quite possible that Fastolf sent a similar message
to Bingham by Scrope, and to Yelverton by Paston and Howes.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 146.] Fenn considers this letter to have been called
forth by the summons sent by the King to the Lords of both parties to
come to London, in the beginning of 1458, with a view to a
reconciliation. On this view, the excuse of illness given by Salisbury
is, of course, a&nbsp;mere pretence, and, moreover, was not adhered to,
for within a week after it was penned Salisbury actually was in London
with a company of 400 horse and 80 knights and squires (<i>see</i>
Botoner’s letter of the 1st February). This sudden change of tactics on
the part of the Earl seems to me hardly probable, and I see no reason
why the letter should not refer to a genuine illness upon a different
occasion. Nevertheless, as there is no positive evidence on the subject,
I&nbsp;leave the date suggested by Fenn, with a query, on which the
reader may use his own judgment.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 40.] As there is no distinct evidence of the date of
this letter, I&nbsp;have placed it after another paper written by Agnes
Paston, and making mention of Clement, though I rather suspect it may be
a little later. It certainly cannot have been, as Fenn supposes, written
within a short time after William Paston’s death in 1444, as Clement
Paston was then only two years old. From some of the expressions we
might be led to suspect that John Paston was in trouble at the time.</p>

<p>You shall know the governance here on Paston’s coming to you better
than I can write. The King is gone to Berkhamstead, ‘and it is said my
Lords Somerset, Exeter, Clifford, and Egremont, that rode upon Thursday
last to the King, they come again to London; and the Lord of
Northumberland is come to the King at this time after the Lords’
departing out of London with 3000 or 4000 people, as it is said, but all
toke (?) to a good peace, and reconysances made to keep the peace in
great sums till Michaelmas, that in the mean time to make a throw peace
final by means of all the Lords.’ John Vyncent of Bentley was at the
Priory of Lewes in Sussex this week, and says that sixty sail of
Frenchmen were sailing before the coasts, keeping the sea. The Lord
Fauconberg is at Hampton with his navy. Edmund Clere of the King’s house
has heard from a soldier of Calais that Crowmer and Blakeney is much
spoken of among Frenchmen. ‘The King’s safe conduct is not holden but
broken, as it is voiced here, and that will do no good to merchants till
it be amended.’ Figs and raisins are dear at 18<i>s.</i> the croc (?),

[From Fenn, i. 170.] At the date of this letter Sir John Fastolf must
have been in Norfolk, and William Worcester in London. From the time
that the former went into Norfolk in 1454, till the end of the year
1457, Worcester seems generally to have resided with him; but in the
beginning of 1458 he was in London, and it appears by the Castlecombe
<span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span> (Add. <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> 28,208, B.M. pp. 39,&nbsp;42) that he was
holding courts at Castlecombe in Wiltshire in June and July of that
year, and that, in November of the same year, he and Fastolf were both
together in London. It is probable, therefore, that he was in London in
August, before Fastolf had come up. Indeed, he appears not to have
returned to Norfolk till January following; so that in August he might
quite well have devoted himself to the study of French in the
expectation of a lengthened stay.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 328.] The writer of this letter is Agnes Paston’s
daughter Elizabeth, for whose marriage, as we have seen, there had been
a good deal of negotiating in past years (<i>see</i> Nos. 93, 94, 236,
250, 252), and who has now become the wife of Robert Poynings. As the
3rd of January, the day on which this letter is dated, was a Wednesday,
the year must be 1459. The 3rd of January did not fall on a Wednesday
again till 1470, by which time Elizabeth Paston was no longer the wife
of Robert Poynings, but his widow, for he was killed at the second
battle of St. Albans on the 17th Feb. 1461.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 174.] The only years during the married life of John and
Margaret Paston (except when their eldest son was a mere child), in
which the Sunday preceding Ascension Day fell some time before the 10th
of May, were 1456 and 1459. In the former year the King could not either
have been or have intended to be at Leicester on the 10th of May. In
1459 the Privy Seals show that he was at Northampton on the 14th, 18th,
and 19th of May, and it is quite possible he may have been at Leicester
on the 10th. In 1464 Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span> was at
Leicester in May, and the Sunday before Ascension Day was the 6th of
May; but it is not probable this letter was written in that year, for
two reasons. In the first place, Margaret Paston could hardly have hoped
for an answer from her husband&mdash;who may be presumed to have been in
London&mdash;in time to have sent his son to be at Leicester on the
10th; secondly, Letter 375, which is evidently of the same year as this,
would probably have been signed ‘John Paston, K.’ (<i>i.e.</i>
Knight).</p>

phrase, which he has modernised ‘to bemoan.’</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The writer of
this letter was put to death at Calais on the 25th June 1460, having
been taken at Sandwich when about to go thither in aid of the Duke of
Somerset against the Earl of Warwick. The date cannot be in that year,
and how much earlier it may be is quite uncertain, unless we suppose
‘mon petit homme d’armes’ to be Paston’s eldest son, who, as we have
seen, was summoned to perform military service in 1459.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] It appears by
the Bishops’ Registers at Norwich that John Clerk was instituted to the
living of Rendlesham on the 20th June 1459 on the King’s presentation.
This letter must have been written four days later in ignorance of the
fact. Clerk’s predecessor was John Sybton, administration of whose goods
was granted on the 19th May 1450.</p>

letter as Fenn has printed it, but the style is unmistakably that of
Brackley, to whom he attributes it. The original was endorsed in an
ancient hand, according to Fenn, ‘Littera fratris Doctoris Brackley per

[From Fenn, iv. 38.] This letter is referred by Fenn to the beginning of
Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>’s reign, but on a careful
examination I think it must be earlier, as William Jenney’s proceedings,
even in the first year of Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>,
were by no means friendly to John Paston. The Lord Scales here mentioned
must therefore be the Lord Scales of Henry <span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>’s time, who was murdered in July 1460, and the
letter, having been written in August, cannot be later than 1459. In
that year, as will be seen by Letter 377, John Paston’s eldest son had
already begun active life, and I am inclined to think that it is the
precise year in which the present letter was written. John Paston, the
second, was at that time not more than nineteen years of age, and we
hear nothing of his doings earlier. The manor of Sporle was inherited by
John Paston, senior, from his father the judge.</p>

ibidem de novo constructæ, ex parte australi chori sive cancelli, sub

quæ idem Johannes Paston et alii feoffati per ipsum Johannem Fastolf seu
suos feoffatos de dictis abbate et conventu tenent, vel tantum inde
quantum idem Johannes dictis monachis vel presbyteris dare voluerit.
Item legavit, ordinavit, et præcepit omnia debita sua fideliter persolvi
et quæcumque per ipsum forisfacta de quibus constare poterit, emendari,
restitui,<a class = "tag" name = "tag164_1" id = "tag164_1" href =

Johannem Brakley, doctorem theologiæ; Willelmum Yelverton, unum
justiciariorum Domini Regis; Johannem Paston, armigerum; Henricum
Filongley, armigerum; Dominum Thomam Howes, presbyterum; et Willelmum
Worcester; quos modum et formam executionis et administrationis bonorum
suorum per executores suos fiend’ sic limitavit, voluit, disposuit, et
modificavit; videlicet, quod prædicti Johannes Paston et Thomas Howes
solum et ante alios executores prædictos subeant et habeant
administrationem et dispositionem omnium bonorum mobilium, catallorum ac
denariorum ex venditione omnium terrarum et tenementorum suorum
vendendorum et proficuorum eorundem terrarum et tenementorum
provenientum, ut ipsi duo soli ea disponant pro salute animæ suæ, et
quod alii executores supradicti abstineant se ab omni administratione
dictorum bonorum suorum, nisi pro modo, forma, causa, loco, et tempore
quibus per ipsos Johannem Paston et Thomam Howes ad eorem juramenta pro
dicta administratione fuerint evocati pariter et rogati; et quod nullus
dictorum aliorum executorum suorum sine consensu et voluntate ac
advisamento dictorum Johannes Paston et Thomæ Howes capiat aliquid seu
distribuat de bonis suis mobilibus et catallis prædictis, nec
venditionem eorundem neque terrarum nec tenementorum prædictorum faciat,
nec aliqua sibi debita recipiat, neque aliquos creditores suos quovis
modo acquiet et, neque, prædictis Johanne Paston et Thoma Howes
viventibus et administrare bona sua volentibus, aliquis alius executorum
prædictorum administrationem bonorum suscipiat suorum, sed quod quantum
dicti alii sui executores ad [<i>sic</i>] eorem singuli prædict’ Johanni
Paston et Thomæ Howes in quibuscunque egibilibus [<i>sic</i>] quæ
hujusmodi testamentum et ultimam voluntatem concernentibus,
favorabiliter assistant et succurrant cum per eosdem fuerint ad hoc
requisiti. Voluit tamen quod si alter prædictorum Johannis et Thomæ
recusaverit onus administrationis bonorum hujusmodi subire, vel ante
administrationem functam obierit, quod tunc ille dictorum duorum
executorum suorum administrare volens eligat unum de executoribus
prædictis sibi associandis quem putaverit in hiis sibi magis idoneum, et
ita voluit fieri de omnibus aliis executoribus præscriptis; videlicet,
quod uno moriente vel deficiente de duobus, alter loco ipsius ad
electionem administrationem incumbent’ substituatur et assumatur. Si
autem ambo executores prædicti onus recusaverint subire administrationis
prædictæ, vel ambo executores administrationem incumbentes moriantur
antequam substituantur executores alii, voluit quod tunc illi duo
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page166" id = "page166">166</a></span>
executores viventes prædictam administrationem subeant et habeant quos
major pars executorum viventium sui testamenti duxerit eligendos, et
quod illi duo administrationem subeuntes ad dictos Dominum Episcopum et
Dominum de Beauchamp, Nicolaum Abbatem de Langley, Johannem Stokes,
Fratrem Johannem Bracley, Willelmum Yelverton, Henricum Filongley, et
Willelmum Worcester recursum habeant pro eorum consilio et advisamento
obtinendo in causis arduis et materiis requisitis. Supervisores vero
dicti testamenti reverendissimum in Christo patrem et dominum, Dominum
Thomam Dei gratia Cantuariensem Archiepiscopum, Walterum Episcopum
Norwicensem, Magistrum Robertum Popy clericum, et Hugonem Fenn, Domini
Regis auditorem, ordinavit et constituit, et voluit quod dicti duo
executores onus administrationis subeuntes remunerarentur secundum
merita laborum suorum et diligentiam in præmissis expediendis juxta
discretionem dicti Domini Episcopi Wintoniensis et Magistri Johannis
Stokes, seu majoris partis aliorum executorum viventium. Supervisores
vero prædicti et cæteri executores remunerarentur secundum merita
laborum suorum per discretionem duorum executorum dictæ administrationi
incumbentium. Et voluit quod si quis prædictorum per eum superius
nominatorum dictos Johannem Paston et Thomam Howes in officio suo
hujusmodi seu circa administrationem bonorum ejusdem defuncti quoquomodo
impediverit, turbaverit, vexaverit, molestaverit, vel inquietaverit, aut
aliquid prædictorum facere præsumpserit vel conatus fuerit, ab
administratione bonorum suorum omnino removeatur, et si quid præmissorum
ante susceptionem administrationis hujusmodi attemptaverit, ipsum ad
administrationem hujusmodi nullatenus admitti voluit et declaravit.

[From Fenn, iii. 346.] This letter belongs to the latter part of the
year 1459. After the dispersion of the Duke of York’s army near Ludlow
in October of that year, commissions were granted to various persons to
arrest and punish his adherents. Even as early as the 14th of October,
Lord Rivers and others were commissioned to seize their lands and goods
in different counties (see <i>Patent Roll</i>, 38 Hen. <span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>, p. 1, m. 12, <i>in dorso</i>). But this letter,
we are inclined to think, was written about six or seven weeks later,
for it will be seen by the next that Bocking, who is here stated to have
been with my Lord Chancellor ‘this term,’ must have been in attendance
on him before the 7th December, and therefore, we may presume, during
Michaelmas term, which ended on the 28th November. It is, however,
difficult to judge, from the very slender allusion to Sir John Fastolf,
whether this letter was written before or after the old knight’s death.
Brackley here speaks of having been quite recently in Somersetshire,
which is not unlikely to have been in the middle of October, when the
Earls of March, Warwick, and Salisbury withdrew into the West. Brackley,
as will be seen, was a great partisan of these Lords, and may very well
have accompanied them; but not long before Fastolf’s death he appears to
have been at Norwich.</p>

and speaks of a conversation the writer had with him about the
management of his lands a twelvemonth before Hallowmas preceding the

unable to support any conversation for want of breath, so that the

[From Fenn, i. 182.] The date of this letter is ascertained partly by
the reference in the suppressed passage to Sir John Fastolf’s interment,

This must be a sneer. The truth, as recorded by Botoner himself in his

surprised Sandwich, where they took Lord Rivers and his son Anthony
prisoners, and carried them back to Calais.</p>

must be 1460, as it is clearly not long after the death of Sir John

1459, after the death of Fastolf and after the attainder of the Yorkists

January and May. Indeed, though the language is mysterious, its

[From Fenn, iii. 244.] This manifesto must have been issued in July
1460, after the battle of Northampton, when the King was in the hands of
the confederate Lords. It certainly was not, as Fenn supposes, in 1455,
after the battle of St. Albans, when the Earl of March was only thirteen
years old and the Duke of York, his father, was made Protector. York had
not come over from Ireland in July 1460, and is consequently not named
in this document.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 36.] According to Fenn, Margaret Paston’s uncle, John
Berney, second son of John Berney, Esq. of Reedham, died in July 1461,
and he accordingly places this letter in that year. It is evident,
however, that John Berney was dead at the date of <a href =
"#letter431">Nos. 431</a> and <a href = "#letter462">462</a>, the former
written in January <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘1561’">1461</ins>, the latter certainly not so late as
the 28th July in the same year, for Thomas Denys was murdered at the
very beginning of the month. Indeed, it is clear that in <a href =
"#letter462">No.&nbsp;462</a> Margaret Paston wishes to arrange about
the approaching anniversary of her uncle’s death. John Berney must
therefore have died in July 1460, although from the troubled character
of the times his will (which is preserved in the Principal Registry at
Somerset House), made on the 2nd June 1460 (Monday after the Feast of
St. Petronilla the Virgin), was not proved till the 1st December
1461.</p>

<p><a class = "tag" name = "note223_2" id = "note223_2" href =
"#tag223_2">223.2</a>
When Berney’s will was proved at Lambeth, 1st December 1461,
administration was granted provisionally to Thomas Hooler, who was to
send in accounts before the morrow of the Conversion of St. Paul
(Jan.&nbsp;26) following. Power was, however, reserved of committing
administration to John Paston. But John Paston did not appear on the
day, and left the undivided administration to Hooler.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
is by an unknown writer, and very uncertain as to date. It shows that
Tuddenham, Wentworth, and Heydon, all adherents of the House of
Lancaster, were desirous of a compromise with Yelverton and Paston. The
year 1460, some time after the battle of Northampton, is perhaps as
likely a period as any.</p>

cum Thorp de Scacario carcere collocando, &amp;c. Et tunc eorum clientes
et eis adhærentes non possent, ymmo nec auderent, nocere populo patriæ
bonæ disposicionis. Certe si in hac parte fideliter laborare in effectu
volueritis, dominus Comes Warwic, et omnes sibi et suis benivoli essent
vobis multiformiter obligati, et tunc esset in Norffolchia mansio
concors et valde pacificus. Utinam bona voluntas vestra non sit in hac
materia pigra, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2º. Item, quod Episcopus Norwicensis esset in curia Regis ad tempus,
vel in parliamento omnino, quia hic parvum bonum facit, nisi supportando
iniquos et paci patriæ contrarios; est enim satis dives ad comprestandum
pecunias Regi in necessitate sua. Ipse enim cum ducissa Suff. et aliis
personis prænominatis sunt Reginæ et principi maxime favorabiles cum
totis suis viribus; et ideo maxime expediens est parti Regis et comitis
Warwic subtrahere, diminuere, et pocius opprimere, vires omnium illorum
prædictorum eis et suis continue malignantium ex adverso, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3º. Item, vos et vestri præmunire poteritis, si placeat, Doctores
Kyrry et Godard quomodo fama communis hic volat continue per Boreales et
eorum fautores quod Regina ac sui firmiter statuerunt unanimi decreto
ipsos doctores et me non solum morti ignominiose tradere sed etiam
generaliter omnes Fratres Minores citra flumen Trent commorantes
interfici facere. Sed Magister Vergeant cum socio qui in sermonibus
Reginam cum principe solempniter recommendat et in suis missis Reginam
nominatim specificat per instanciam Ducissæ Suff. erit cum socio
privilegiatus ab hac punicione.</p>

<p>4º. Item, bonum esset quod juvenis dux Suff. cum suis militibus et
armigeris uteretur suis calcaribus et jam probaretur in bello cui esset
fidelis, an caro vel piscis. Si T.&nbsp;T. cum suis prius recitatis
essent unde memorati in parliamento a dominis et communibus, non dubium
quin puniti essent causatores insurrectionis falsorum Regis contra
Comitem Warwic apud pontem Westmonasterii, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5º. Item, memorari dignetur dominus Comes Warwic quomodo T. T.,
J.&nbsp;H., J.&nbsp;A., et H.&nbsp;T.,<a class = "tag" name = "tag228_1"
id = "tag228_1" href = "#note228_1">228.1</a> J.&nbsp;W. et cæteri
gravissime comminantur priorem Wals’ [Walsingham], &amp;c.</p>

<p>6º. Item, caveant Comes Marchiæ et Comes Warwic ne quovis modo sit
inter eos controversia, sed sint omnino unanimes et concordes, nec
aliqua cupiditas consiliariorum suorum faveat alicui eorum adversario
propter lucrum bonorum in finalem deperdicionem ipsorum et amicorum
suorum.</p>

<p>7º. Item, fiat per decretum parliamenti diminutio juris peritorum ac
legis attornatorum Suff. et Norff. punicioque taxata singulorum
oppressorum, generosos ac eorum liberos, nativosque tenentes cotidie et
annuatim gravissime infestancium.</p>

rancoris et invidiæ maliciose agitati, nituntur pro posse suo, et totis

[Add. <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 34,889, f. 156.] This letter
has no date, except that it was written on a Friday (<i>feria
sexta</i>). It might, perhaps, be a little hazardous to date it Friday
the 2nd January 1461, just after news of the defeat and death of the
Duke of York reached Norfolk; but this date agrees well with the warning
to John Paston to ride to London with all haste for his safety, which
can hardly mean anything else than that the Lancastrian party, with
their Norfolk supporters (several of whom, indeed, are expressly named
here), were now sure to bear rule.</p>

should have been struck out altogether; for the words <i>a me primo</i>

[From Fenn, iii. 404.] As executor to Sir John Fastolf, Paston must have
taken possession of Caister soon after his death. The Duke of Norfolk,
however, pretended a title to it, and, as we shall find hereafter, had
dispossessed Paston by June 1461. This letter, dated on Saturday after
the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul, must therefore have been
written in January 1461, as in 1460&mdash;the only other probable
year&mdash;that feast (25th January) fell on Friday, and a letter
written on Saturday after the feast would not have referred to the
Friday after the same feast as a past date.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 412.] ‘This letter,’ says Fenn, ‘has no direction, and
lest it should be opened, the paper which fastens the seal is, along the
edge, marked with lines by a pen, which communicate with the latter
(<i>qu.</i> with the <i>letter</i>?), by which means the receiver might
easily have discovered any attempts to have opened it, as the lines
would not then have exactly coincided again. On the back of it, but in a
later hand, is written, “A&nbsp;lettre to J.&nbsp;Paston, ar., from his
wife.”’</p>

<p>Fenn considers, I think with great probability, that this letter was
written ‘just before the important crisis that finished Henry’s reign,
and placed Edward on the throne,’ when Margaret of Anjou was expected in
London after winning the second battle of St. Albans. Giles Saint Loe
was sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1458.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Frends</span>, this holy tyme, as owr moder
Holy Chirch maketh mension, the Holy Gost came from hevyn, and lighted
in the disciples of Crist, inflamyng them with connyng, and strenghyng
them with grace. And be cause the doctrine and prechyng of them shuld go
thurghought all the werd, furst thei wer to be enfourmed and taught
connyng, and to be strenth with awdacide and grace, and than to be
endewed and yovyn all manner of langags that thei myght prechyn to all
maner of naciones, so that tho naciones that thei preched to myght
understond them, and every naciones his owyn tonge; and so thees

ever thei preached, were ther never so many naciones present, ich nacion
thought that thei spokyn in ther owyn langage&mdash;etenim illud
loquebantur variis linguis Apostoli.</p>

<p>Frends, iij. thyngs be necessary in prechyng to hym that shall
prechyn thurgh the werd as the Appostell dede&mdash;that is to sey,
connyng, boldnesse, and langags. If thei had had connyng and none
audacite, but have fered to have preched, it shuld litill a profited, as
we have examplles dayly at Cambrige, exempli [gratia]<a class = "tag"

eloquensye ner copiousnesse of langage, so that he preche that his
audiens is most excercised in, that thei may understand hym, elles it
profiteth not.</p>

<p>Therfor thes holy Appostill[es], be for thei shuld prechyn, furst
thei wer to be confirmed and strenghed. Our Lord strenghed them be under
nemyng,<a class = "tag" name = "tag257_1" id = "tag257_1" href =

I&nbsp;taught you on Estern day. Therfor ye shall pray to God be good
werkyng, right full lebyring, and in good deds perseveryng.</p>

<p>Frends, ye owe for to ask of God that your joy may ben a full joy and
perfight; we may never have a full joy in this werd, wher as ever among
folwyth hevynesse. A&nbsp;man joyth sumtyme in gold and sylver, and in
gret substaunce of erdly gods, in bewte of women, but this joy is not
perfyght&mdash;but this joy is not stabill, but it is mutabill as a
shadow; for he that this joyth in the bewte of his wyffe, it may fortune
to morwyn he shall folwyn her to chirch up on a bere. But if ye wull
knowyn what is a full and a wery joy, truly forgevenesse of synne and
everlestyng blisse, wher as is never sikenesse, hunger, ner thurst, ner
no maner of disseas, but all welth, joy, and prosperite, &amp;c. Ther be
iij. maner of joys, the on void, a&nbsp;nother half full, the thred is a
full joy. The furst is plente of werdly gods, the seconde is Gostly
grace, the threde is everlestyng blisse. The furst joy, that is affluens
of temporall gods, is called a veyn joy, for if a man wer set at a bord
with delicate mets and drynks, and he sey a cawdron boyllyng a forn hym
with pykke and bronston, in the which he shuld be throwyn naked as sone
as he had dyned; for he shuld joy mych in his deliciose mets, it shuld
be but a veyn joy.</p>

<p>Right so doth the joy of a covetouse man, if he sey what
<span class = "pagenum">

peyn his sowle shuld suffre in helle for the myskepyn and getyn of his
good, he shuld not joy in his tresore, ut in Libro Decalogorum, ‘Quidam
homo dives,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Semiplenum gaudium est quando quis in præsenti gaudet et tunc
cogitans de futuris dolet, ut in quodam libro Græco, ‘Quidam Rex
Græciæ,’ &amp;c. Her ye may se but half a joy; how [<i>who</i>] shuld
joy in this werd, if he remembred hym of the peynes of the toder werd?

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
is printed from a corrected draft in a hand which may be that of
Margaret Paston, writing in her husband’s name. The beginning may
perhaps refer to the impending marriage of Richard Southwell with Amy,
daughter of Sir Edmund Wichingham, which took place, according to
Blomefield (x.&nbsp;274), about the beginning of Edward <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span>’s reign. From the mention made of Osbert
Mundford, however, the letter cannot be later than 1460. The ravishment
of Jane Boys, as here related, corresponds so closely with that of Dame
Joan Beaumont, of which notice will be found in the <i>Rolls of
Parl.</i>, v. 269, that we might almost surmise the same person is
spoken of; but this can hardly be.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 226.] According to Fenn, this letter is in the original
‘without either date, name, or direction,’ the contents only proving it
to have been written by ‘one of John Paston’s sons.’ Nevertheless, in a
very misleading way, the signature ‘John Paston’ is inserted at the foot
of the right-hand copy, with a reference to a facsimile of the signature
of John Paston the youngest. There is every appearance, however, that
John Paston the youngest really was the writer, and that the date is, as
Fenn supposes, just after the accession of Edward <span class =

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
was evidently written in the beginning of Edward <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span>’s reign; and as it appears by <a href =
"#letter458">No.&nbsp;458</a> that Paston had already been dispossessed
of Caister, not indeed by the Duke of Suffolk, but by the Duke of
Norfolk, as early as the 5th June 1461, we may presume that this letter,
dated in May, belongs to that year. The margin of the letter is slightly
mutilated, but the words which are lost are obvious, and have been

[From Fenn, iv. 10.] The writer of this letter speaks of having served
with the Earl of Warwick at the battle of Northampton in July 1460, and
again at the second battle of St. Albans in February 1461. We know from
later letters that he was murdered in the beginning of July following.
As he dates from York, and speaks of being ‘here in the King’s house,’
the date would appear to be about the 10th of May, on which day we find

[Douce <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 393, f. 85.] The date of
this letter may, with great probability, be attributed to the year 1461.
It certainly cannot be later, as the writer was executed for high
treason in February 1462. He was found to have been corresponding with
Margaret of Anjou for the restoration of Henry <span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>, but the discovery must have been much later
than May 1461. Sir John Howard, who, for his services to the House of
York, was afterwards made Duke of Norfolk, appears to have had great
influence just after the accession of Edward <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span>, which he used in a very overbearing manner; and
we have already seen, by the last letter, that the Earl of Oxford’s
servant, Thomas Denyes, was at this very time suffering much persecution
at his hands.</p>

to avoide, and so he did. And thanne my Lorde sent for Sothwell. And in

no displesur; for he is advised to kepe it still unto the tyme that he
hath spaken with his Highnesse, for he trusteth to God to schewe suche

<p>Berthelmew Elysse hathe ben with my Lorde, and made a relesse to my

I&nbsp;can thynke for the sam mater. And Thomas Fastolf whas there the

have hem with you to London, to prove his titill noght. Ther be but ii.
or iij. men with in the place, and if ye thynke it best to do it, send

<p>Also I here no word of Master William, nor of the writts for the

Childermas, or Holy Innocents’ Day, the 28th of December, fell on Sunday
in the year 1460. The day of the week on which it fell used to be
considered ominous or unlucky during the whole ensuing year. This
superstition seems to have continued as late as the beginning of the
eighteenth century, and is alluded to by Addison in the seventh number
of the <i>Spectator</i>. It is not true, however, that Edward’s
coronation was put off till Monday. It took place on the Sunday which
had been originally appointed for it, but the processions and pageantry
were deferred till next day. The following is the account of the matter
given in a contemporary chronicle in the Cottonian <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span>, Vitellius, A.&nbsp;xvi:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘And upon the morn, Sunday, which was St. Peter’s Even, and the 28th
day of June, he was crowned at Westminster with great solemnity of
bishops and other temporal lords. And upon the morn after, the King went
crowned again in Westminster Abbey, in the worship of God and St. Peter.
And upon the next morn he went also crowned in St. Paul’s in the worship
of God and St. Paul; and there the angel came down and censed him. At
which time was as great a multitude of people in Paul’s as ever was seen
afore in any days.’</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 18.] This letter speaks of the county of Norfolk as
being in an unquiet state, and of John Paston as having been elected
knight of the shire. It will be seen by <a href =
"#letter458">No.&nbsp;458</a> that writs for an election were expected
as early as the 5th of June in 1461, and as I find that the writer of
this letter was murdered on the 4th of July following, the date is
probably about the very beginning of that month. From what is said at
the beginning of the letter about Paston’s absence from home, it was
evidently some time after the last, which was written on the very day of
his departure.</p>

is printed from a draft which is partly in John Paston’s own hand. The
contents clearly refer to, first, the Norfolk election of 1461, which it
was proposed to confirm by a new meeting of the electors at the
shire-house; and secondly, the necessity of electing a new coroner after
the murder of Thomas Denys. The date is therefore certain.</p>

man as will not lye: on the xj<sup>th</sup> day of October the Kinge
said, ‘We have sent two privy sealys to Paston by two yeomen of our
chamber, and he disobeyeth them; but we will send him anoder tomorrowe,
and by Gods mercye, and if he come not then he sall dye for it. We will
make all oder men beware by him how they sall disobey our writinge.
A&nbsp;servant of our hath made a complainte of him. I&nbsp;cannot
thinke that he hath informed us all truely, yet not for that, we will
not suffer him to disobey our writinge; but sithen he disobeyeth our
writinge, we may beleve the better his gydinge is as we be informed.’
And therwith he made a great avowe that if he [<i>ye</i>] come not at
the third commandement ye xulde dye therefore. This man that told me
this is as well learned a man as any is in England; and the same
xj<sup>th</sup> day of October, he advised me to send a man to yow in
all the hast that might be to lett yow have knowlache, and that ye xulde
not lett for none excuse, but that ye xulde make the man good cheere and
come as hastily ye might to the Kinge, for he understandeth so much that
the King will keep his promise. Notwithstanding, by mine advice, if ye
have his letter or the messenger come to you, come to the Kinge wards or
ye meet
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page314" id = "page314">314</a></span>
with him, and when ye come ye must be suer of a great excuse. Also if ye
doe well, come right stronge, for Howards wife made her bost that if any
of her husbands men might come to yow ther yulde goe noe penny for your
life; and Howard hath with the Kinge a great fellowship.</p>

<p>This letter was written the same day that the Kinge said these words,
and the same day that it was told me, and that day was the
xj<sup>th</sup> day of October as abovesaid; and on the next morning
send I forth a man to yow with this letter, and on the same day send the
Kinge the third privye seale to you. Also he that tolde me this seid
that it were better for yow to come up than to be fotte out of your
house with streingth, and to abide the Kings judgement therin, for he
will take your contumacy to great displeasure. Also, as I understand,
the Duke of Norffolk hath made a great complaint of yow to the King, and
my Lord of Suffolk<a class = "tag" name = "tag314_1" id = "tag314_1"
href = "#note314_1">314.1</a> and Howard and Wyngfelde helpe well to
every day and call upon the King against yow. The Kinge is at this day
at Grenewich, and ther will be still till the Parliament beginne. Some
say he will goe to Walsingham, but Mr. Sotyll seid in the aulle in the
Temple that he harde no worde of any such pilgrimage. No more, &amp;c.
Written the xj<sup>th</sup> day of October at midnight.</p>

<p>My nevew John tolde me also that he supposed ther were out
proclamacions against yow, &amp;c. the same day.

This letter is reprinted from the <i>Norfolk Archæology</i>, vol. iv. p.
26, where it is edited from a transcript contained in a <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> genealogy of the Paston family drawn up by
Sandford, author of the <i>Genealogical History of England</i>. The
references to Howard’s animosity against Paston, and to an approaching
Parliament, prove clearly that this letter is of the year 1461.</p>

John de la Pole, son and heir of William, Duke of Suffolk, who was
attainted in 1450, was not restored to the Dukedom till the 23rd of
March 1463; but being in favour at court, and having married Edward
<span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>’s sister, he seems even at this
time to have been popularly called ‘my Lord of Suffolk.’</p>

that they receyved there it drwe upon a xxiiij<sup>ti</sup> <i>li.</i>

i nough who payed and wo paied not. All the grete fermours have payed.
And as for the kepyng of the place ther be therin iiij. men, and on of

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
was written in a year in which the morrow of All Souls’ Day (<i>i.e.</i>
the 3rd November) fell on Tuesday. The Dominical letter of the year must
therefore be D. This was the case in 1461, and no other year will suit a
letter addressed to John Paston, junior. For if we go back there is no
earlier year in which D was the Dominical letter till we come to 1450,
when John Paston, junior, was only ten years old; and if we go forward
the next is 1467, which was after John Paston the father’s death.</p>
